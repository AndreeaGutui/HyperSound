# HyperSound

HyperSound is a mobile application that continuously measures the surrounding decibel levels and notifies users if they are in a noisy environment. This helps individuals, especially those sensitive to sound, protect their hearing.

## Features

### Planned Features

- **Real-time Decibel Measurement**: Continuously monitors sound levels using the device microphone.
- **Noise Alerts**: Notifies users when noise levels exceed a safe threshold.
- **Background Operation**: Runs in the background, measuring decibels even when the app is closed.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Displays sound levels in a central circular gauge with a bottom navigation bar.
- **AI-Powered Sound Mapping**: Identifies and marks quiet places on a map.
- **Tinnitus-Friendly Music**: Provides a selection of soothing sounds for users with tinnitus.
- **Customizable Alerts**: Allows users to set personalized noise thresholds.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (Dart)
- **Backend**: Planned future implementation
- **Decibel Measurement**: Kotlin integration for accurate sound level detection
